# Wamu CGGMP

A Rust implementation of [CGGMP20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060.pdf) with augmentations as described by the [Wamu protocol](https://wamu.tech/specification) for building [threshold signature](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/threshold-signatures-explained) wallets controlled by multiple [decentralized identities](https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/).

It uses the [Wamu Core (wamu-core)](https://github.com/wamutech/wamu-rs/tree/master/crates/core) crate for [Wamu](https://wamu.tech/specification)'s core sub-protocols and augmentations, and [Webb tool's cggmp-threshold-ecdsa](https://github.com/webb-tools/cggmp-threshold-ecdsa) crate for the [CGGMP20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060.pdf) implementation that it wraps and augments.
