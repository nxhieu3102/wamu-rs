# Wamu

A collection of modular Rust libraries for implementing the [Wamu protocol](https://wamu.tech/specification) for building [threshold signature](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/threshold-signatures-explained) wallets controlled by multiple [decentralized identities](https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/).

**NOTE:** ðŸš§ This project is still work in progress, check back over the next few weeks for regular updates.

## Installation and Usage

Check the readme of each crate for installation and usage instructions and links to documentation.

## Documentation

- Wamu Core ([wamu-core](/crates/core)): [https://docs.rs/wamu-core/latest/wamu_core/](https://docs.rs/wamu-core/latest/wamu_core/)

Or you can access documentation locally by running the following command from the project root

```shell
cargo doc --open
```

To open crate specific docs, see instructions in the readme in each crate's directory.

## Testing

You can run unit tests for all the core functionality by running the following command from the project root

```
